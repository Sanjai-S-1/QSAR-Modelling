# QSAR Classification Model for Predicting Mutagenicity

## Overview

Welcome to the QSAR Classification Model project! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for the mutagenicity of chemical compounds. QSAR, or Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship, is a powerful approach in chemoinformatics that correlates the structure of chemical compounds with their biological activity.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to predict whether a given chemical compound is mutagenic or not based on its molecular structure. The machine learning model employed here utilizes a QSAR approach, considering various molecular descriptors and features to make accurate predictions.
